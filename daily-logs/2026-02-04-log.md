# Daily Log — 2026-02-04

## Focus
Repository cleanup, security sanitization, and access control practice using a fictional company structure.

---

## Work Completed

### Repository & Structure
- Verified full repository tree structure.
- Confirmed separation of:
  - scripts
  - labs
  - logs
  - documentation
- Added existing local scripts to version control:
  - `lab-security-hardening.sh`
  - `demo.sh`
  - `test.sh`
  - Dockerfile for lab usage

### Security & Sanitization
- Reviewed repository for sensitive information using `grep`.
- Identified SSH authentication logs containing IP addresses and usernames.
- Sanitized audit logs to ensure:
  - No real hostnames
  - No real usernames
  - No real IP addresses
- Replaced data with **synthetic / documentation-safe values**.
- Confirmed public repository is safe to share.

### Audit Logger Lab
- Validated `audit-logger` structure:
  - logs
  - reports
  - scripts
- Confirmed automated audit report generation is working.
- Logs now contain anonymized, non-production data.

### User & Permission Exercise (Cybershield Lab)
- Continued using **Cybershield** fictional company model.
- Created new analyst role:
  - **blackwidow** (new recruit)
- Directory created under:
  - `labs/cybershield/analysts/blackwidow`
- Permissions verified:
  - Private analyst directory (no world access)
  - Read/execute access to `avengers` directory
- No changes made to:
  - root user
  - sudo configuration
  - system-wide permissions

### Safety Notes
- Avoided any configuration that could lock out the admin user.
- No real credentials, IPs, or hostnames committed.
- All exercises performed at the filesystem / documentation level only.

---

## Commands Used (High Level)
- `tree`
- `ls -ld`
- `grep -R`
- `chmod`
- `git add / commit / push`

---

## Next Steps
- Create simple task files for Black Widow (bogus data).
- Practice group-based permissions safely.
- Document Docker lab purpose and current state.
- Continue VM documentation (pfSense, Linux server, Windows).

---

## Notes
This lab remains **local-only**, **isolated**, and **safe for public sharing**.

# Daily Log – 2026-02-04

## Summary
Documented Docker and VM lab intent.
Continued organizing sysadmin-lab structure.
Reviewed permissions and logging workflow.

## Labs / Environment
- Docker lab documented (security-focused intent)
- VM inventory updated:
  - pfSense
  - Ubuntu Server
  - Windows 10 (downloaded)
  - Windows Server 2025 (downloaded)
  - Kali Linux (installed or pending verification)

## Notes
Focused on documentation hygiene and lab isolation.
No services exposed externally.

## Next Steps
- Verify Kali installation
- Continue VM role documentation
- Begin Network Traffic Analysis lab
