# Daily Lab Log - 2026-02-02 (Monday)

## 🎯 Today's Focus
- Set up comprehensive documentation system for cyber learning
- System hardening on Ubuntu T460s
- Created interactive learning dashboard
- Built Security Audit Logger lab (all 3 stages + both bonuses)

## 📚 What I Learned
- Proper lab documentation structure and organization
- How to use CLAUDE_STATE.md for conversation continuity
- How to parse log files with grep, awk, sort, uniq
- How bash scripts work (variables, conditionals, loops)
- How cron jobs are scheduled and managed
- How log rotation keeps systems clean

## 💻 Commands Used
```bash
# System hardening verification
sudo systemctl status ssh
sudo ufw status verbose
sudo systemctl --failed
sudo journalctl -b -p err

# Log parsing
grep -c "pattern" file
awk '{print $(NF-3)}'
sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

# Automation
crontab -e / crontab -l
find -perm -o+w
chmod +x script.sh
tee -a file
```

## 🔧 Lab Work
- Platform: Local Ubuntu Lab (T460s)
- Lab 1: System hardening implementation and verification
- Lab 2: Security Audit Logger (stages 1-3, bonus 1-2)
- Difficulty: Beginner → Intermediate
- Key Takeaways: Built a real monitoring tool a SOC analyst would use

## 🐛 Problems Encountered
- Problem: Tried to source .bashrc while using zsh
- Solution: Switched to .zshrc
- Problem: Markdown backticks got pasted into nano/crontab
- Solution: Used echo pipe method instead (`echo '...' | crontab -`)

## 📝 Security+ Study
- Domain covered: None today (setup + lab day)

## 🎓 TIL
`uniq -c | sort -rn` is the go-to combo for counting and ranking anything in logs

## 📅 Tomorrow's Plan
- [ ] Network Traffic Analysis lab
- [ ] Security+ Domain 4 (Security Operations)
- [ ] Root first HTB box

## 🔗 Resources Used
- Claude AI for lab guidance
- Custom hardening script
